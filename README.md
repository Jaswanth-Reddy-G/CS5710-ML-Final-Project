# Motivation:
* The aviation industry has witnessed a rapid growth in recent years, with an increasing number of people relying on air travel for both business and leisure purposes. As air travel becomes more accessible and affordable, there is a growing demand for accurate and reliable flight ticket price forecasting.
* Predicting ticket prices accurately is essential for airlines, travel agencies, and passengers alike, as it enables better planning, informed decision-making, and cost optimization.
* Traditional approaches to flight ticket price forecasting often rely on historical data and statistical models.

# Objectives:
* Identify the key factors that significantly influence ticket prices and understand their impact on prediction accuracy.
* Perform a comprehensive performance analysis of various machine learning techniques for flight ticket price forecasting.
* Evaluate and compare different algorithms, identify a model with high accuracy and reliability.
* Bridge the gap between machine learning and the aviation industry, contributing to the development of more accurate and reliable flight ticket price forecasting models.

# Problem Statement:
* Develop an accurate and reliable machine learning model for predicting flight fares. The objective is to leverage historical flight data and relevant features to create a model that can effectively estimate the ticket prices for various flight itineraries. The model should be able to handle different airlines, departure times, routes, and other factors that influence fare variations.

# Algorithms Used:
* Linear Regression
* ExtraTrees Regression
* Bagging Regression
* KNeighbours Regression
* RandomForest Regression
* DecisionTree Regression
